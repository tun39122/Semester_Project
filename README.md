# Semester_Project
The topic of this project was inspired by the recent shift in Natural Gas prices, this led me to wonder the price trends of Natural Gas before covid. 
The Semester Long Project focuses on the Global Natural Gas Prices from January 1997 to August 2020
The two APIs chosen for this project are Image Chart and Datahub
Datahub is where I got the data and Image Chart is used to create the two graphs
