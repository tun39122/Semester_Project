# Semester_Project
The topic of this project was inspired by the recent shift in Natural Gas prices, this led me to wonder what the price trends of Natural Gas was overall. 
The Semester Long Project focuses on the Global Natural Gas Prices
The two APIs chosen for this project are Image Chart and Datahub
Datahub is where I got the data and Image Chart is used to create the two graphs
